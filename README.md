This is a project to host the open data and analysis about the Bay Area Regional Transit system budget. The goal is to demonstrate how useful it would be to publish this information monthly as part of an open data portal. 

### Project Status 
Waiting to hear from from BART to clarify the following:
1. how this data corelates to the audited financials. 
2. meaning of the account descriptions
3. meaning of the source abbreviation

Once these are cleared up, a request for the same data for 2016 will be requested. 

### Data
The data was obtained by sending a FOIA request for the line item data for every transaction bart made in Fiscal Year 2015. BART delievered their response on Sept 15th, 2016, in 12 excel files containing the data. 

### Get Started

All you need is jupyter and pandas to get started.
